# SPEC benchmarks

Since SPEC benchmarks are proprietary, we cannot provide the source code of the benchmarks themselves.

Instead, we provide the configuration files that we used to run [SPEC CPU 2017](https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/) benchmarks, as well as the scripts we used to plot the results (Figure 6 in the paper).
